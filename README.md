- 👋 Hi, I’m @oashereena
- 👀 I’m interested in the development of combined state/input/parameter estimation techniques for systems described by nonlinear differential equations, for structural identification
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning algorithms, Unscented and Ensemble Kalman filters, and how to solve a high-dimensional system of linear equations at cheaper cost.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on structural health monitoring projects/monitoring system frameworks building projects
- 📫 How to reach me : oa.shereena21@gmail.com
